## Pull Request Merge Guidelines

You can merge your pull request into master when:

- All checks pass, at least one person has approved the frontend (if changes exist here) and at least one person has approved the backend (if changes exist here), and you have resolved any conversations on the pull request.

**OR**

- It's an 'emergency' (e.g. critical bug fix and no one is around to review, late at night, weekend, etc) and you use your admin privileges to do it.

In both cases after merging if someone has posted a comment you should resolve that comment, even if it's already been merged. This can happen because of the asyncronous nature of pull request reviews.
